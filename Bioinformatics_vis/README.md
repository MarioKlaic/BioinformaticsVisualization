# BioinformaticsVisualization
This project visualizes some of the algorithms from the FER course: bioinformatics 1

The folder Bioinformatics_vis contains both the source code and the distribution version of the tool.

The distribution version is a web page that is run locally through an .exe file which will start it on a local address ( e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000 ) and can be opened through your browser of choice.

Dist.rar contains the distribution version and has been tested and ran on windows. If any issues occur for other operating systems the file "Bioinformatics_vis" can be downloaded in its entirety and
locate yourself within that directory and run pyinstaller command "pyinstaller main.spec" to build your own distribution version with the specifications inside of the .spec file. You may need to change it
if your os requires it. Visit https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#
